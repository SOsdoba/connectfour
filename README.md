# Connect Four

## Overview
This repo outlines the software requirements for the age old classic, ‘Connect Four’. The program will allow for 2 players to play against each other, each choosing the color they wish to use, with a default color set as well. The goal of the game is to end up with a row of 4 of your color.

## The Game 
At the start of the game, the user is prompted to click the start button. Until then, everything is disabled. Once started, each player has a turn to place his/her color token into an empty space. As with the real game, the user drops a token into a column, after which it falls to the lowest available (empty) spot. When a user completes a row of 4 (vertical or horizontal), the game is over. The message box displays “Great Job! Play (x) is the winner.” If all boxes are filled without any of the players achieving a row of 4, the message box should display, “No winner, start over”.

**The full spec can be found in the repo.**
